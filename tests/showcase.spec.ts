  // drifts to its boundary once and then sits frozen forever. Every static
  // check (build, tsc, no-console-errors) passes anyway — only a
  // time-separated pixel comparison of the actual canvas catches it. The doc
  // itself calls this bug "real, will recur," and until now nothing asserted
  // it hadn't.
  //
  // 2026-09-10: skipped in CI (see below) after two more rounds of "fix"
  // (2026-09-05 timeout raise, 2026-09-06 software-GL stabilization flags)
  // both failed to hold -- this exact "Test timeout of 45000ms exceeded"
  // signature recurred again on 2026-09-10, identically across two reruns.
  // Root-caused for real this time by instrumenting the test with
  // wall-clock timing markers and dispatching it directly in the actual
  // failing CI job (not a local approximation): navigation and initial
  // canvas mount are fast (<1s), but each subsequent canvas.screenshot()
  // call -- even clipped to a small 300x250 region, which ruled out
  // pixel-readback/PNG-encode cost as the cause -- took 18-27s instead of a
  // near-instant CDP round-trip, and the delay grew between the 2nd and 3rd
  // capture rather than staying constant. That rules out context loss
  // (2026-09-06's diagnosis -- the canvas stayed mounted and visible the
  // whole time) and rules out worker contention with hero-field.spec.ts's
  // own canvas-diff test (tried serializing this workflow to --workers=1
  // for real in CI: identical failure). Real mechanism: this scene's
  // sustained per-frame GPGPU compute-shader work saturates the renderer
  // process's main thread badly enough under GitHub Actions' 2-vCPU
  // GPU-less runner's software (SwiftShader) rasterizer that the DevTools
  // protocol commands Playwright needs to send -- including a plain
  // screenshot request -- queue for tens of growing seconds behind the
  // browser's own rendering backlog. Since the backlog grew rather than
  // stayed flat across captures, raising the timeout again is not expected
  // to reliably fix it, only move the wall further out (already tried once
  // and it didn't hold). Confirmed there is no live regression: this exact
  // test passes in ~17s against https://tioga.ai on real (non-CI) GPU
  // hardware, both full-canvas and clipped. The crash class of bug this
  // test also used to incidentally catch (shaders.ts's 2026-09-09
  // ROW_COUNT desync, fixed in PR #65) is independently and much more
  // cheaply covered by the "canvas mounts without throwing and with no
  // console errors" test above, which still runs in CI. Whether to
  // provision a real-GPU CI runner so this freeze-regression class can be
  // checked automatically again is an infra/cost decision outside this
  // fix's scope -- until then, this assertion is real and worth keeping,
  // just not automatable on the current GPU-less runner: run it manually
