// Shared governance-ledger data module.
//
// This is the single source of truth for the real excerpt from Tioga's own
// AI routing gateway ledger (JARVIS), captured Sep 8-9 2026 (refreshed from
// the original Jul 17-25 2026 capture — see the "Window refresh, 2026-09-09"
// note below for why and what changed). It backs both
// `/demos/governance-ledger` (the table view) and `/showcase` (the 3D
// scene) — extracted here specifically so the two views can never drift:
// change a row here, both pages change with it.
//
// Not synthetic. Every field traces to a real model call our own
// infrastructure made: what was requested, what actually served it, token
// counts, cost, which pool (free vs. paid) it settled against, and which
// NIST AI RMF functions it evidences. Rows from the gateway's separate
// `claude_max` billing pool (personal Claude subscription usage, not the
// $30/30-day OpenRouter pool this page documents) are deliberately excluded
// from this excerpt — that pool's spend stays private, by design, not an
// oversight.
//
// Window refresh, 2026-09-09: the original Jul 17-25 capture had gone
// stale (audit finding G-10) and needed either a longer window or a
// relabel — the call was to refresh with a genuinely current window
// instead. The real numbers moved a lot since July: back then the free
// tier absorbed most calls (15/17 free, 12/17 at exactly $0); by Sep 8-9,
// real usage volume has grown past what the free tier can cover, so this
// window is 15/16 paid. The mechanism hasn't changed — every call is still
// logged, costed, and capped automatically — what changed is that there's
// simply more real traffic now than the free backends alone can absorb.
// Total spend is still a rounding error against the $30 cap.

// visually close together; the real multi-hour gaps (Sep 8 morning -> Sep 8
// afternoon -> Sep 9 afternoon -> Sep 9 evening) compress to a bounded but
// still-visible pause via a fractional-power curve, so a replay shows the
// real clustering rhythm in the data instead of pretending every call
// arrived at an even cadence.
//
// Date.UTC with numeric arguments, not Date-string parsing, so this is
// identical across every JS engine this site runs on (Node build, Vercel,
// every browser) — no locale/engine string-parsing ambiguity.
