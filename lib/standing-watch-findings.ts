// Single source of truth for Standing Watch's real 9-row findings set —
// extracted 2026-09-14 from app/demos/standing-watch/page.tsx so the HTML
// table, the no-WebGL fallback, and "The Boundary" 3D scene all import the
// same data instead of drifting copies (docs/design/3d-design-standard.md
// §6.4: "data has exactly one source of truth"). Values are unchanged from
// the original inline array — see page.tsx's own header comment for the
// redaction/provenance note (captured 2026-08-10, network-identifying
// details redacted, dates/severities/CVE IDs/narrative arc real and
// unedited).
