// Shared agent-register data module — the "Reach Map" scene's single
// source of truth, mirroring how governance-ledger.ts backs both
// /demos/governance-ledger and /showcase (see that file's own header and
// docs/design/3d-design-standard.md §6.4: one data source, never a second
// driftable copy).
//
// This is a real excerpt from Tioga's own automation estate: the 29
// scheduled launchd jobs already
// listed in app/demos/automation-oversight/page.tsx's SCHEDULED_AUTOMATIONS
// array, plus each job's real read/write surface, real authorization tier,
// and real blast radius — sourced from
// the estate's internal subsystem inventory (its own
// model/cost/blast-radius registry, last updated 2026-09-13) and cross-
// checked against automation-oversight's own RECENT dispositions array.
// Not synthetic, not a composite scenario — every field traces to that
// doc's own wording, cited inline in each row's `note`. This authoring pass
// is itself Deliverable 1 of the Agentic AI Governance Framework offer run
// on Tioga's own estate — see
// the internal 2026-09-13 offer-pilot research note (§1.3, §8) for why this
// dataset (not a composite scenario) was chosen.
//
// Trimmed 2026-09-26 for a public page: no privilege mechanisms, credentials,
// dollar budgets, brokerage references or personal names. Tier, blast radius
// and the approval pattern are unchanged; only reconnaissance-grade detail went.
//
// Three real authorization tiers, matching the proposal's own language
// (sales/proposals/09-agentic-ai-governance-framework.md §4 item 1):
//   - "human-owned"      — the agent may only advise; nothing it does
//                          mutates a system without a person acting on it
//                          (an emailed alert counts as advice, not a write).
//   - "human-supervised" — a write is proposed and a named approver must
//                          act before it lands.
//   - "agent-owned"      — the write lands with no approval gate before it
//                          happens; a human may review after the fact (or
//                          never), but nothing stopped it from landing.
// A single agent can carry more than one tier at once — check-automations
// is the clearest real example (a narrow, bounded auto-implement path is
// agent-owned; everything else stays human-supervised) — so tier lives per
// write edge, not per agent.
