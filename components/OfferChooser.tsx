// Homepage entry-point chooser: three starting routes framed by the buyer's
// situation, not by our catalog. The full catalog (sixteen priced
// engagements across three practices, see app/services/page.tsx) is correct
// and stays reachable at /services — it isn't being cut. Two independent
// adversarial design reviews (2026-09-08) found sixteen offers is too much
// for a first-time visitor to compare on landing, and the 2026-09-19 review
// found the homepage answered "where do I start?" twice — two routes here,
// three offers further down. This is now the only "where to start" on the
// page: one block, three routes (decision recorded 2026-09-19).
