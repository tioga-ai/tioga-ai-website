          For a team that already has a candidate use case and can
          provision read-only sandbox access within a week, this is where
          Tioga&apos;s scoping work starts. It&apos;s not a sales pitch and
          not a free consultation: the output is a written recommendation
          for which engagement actually fits, and a working prototype that
          proves the recommendation rather than just asserting it.

              Access is provisioned read-only, scoped, and time-boxed before
              day one. Interviews run with the people who do the work, the
              people who own the systems, the people who&apos;d have to
              sign off on a control, and the sponsor. From those, a
              current-state map gets built and three to five candidate use
              cases get scored on value, feasibility, blast radius, and how
              controllable the action actually is — a high-value action
              nobody can control isn&apos;t a candidate for a first pilot.
              One use case gets selected with the sponsor, the control
              points get designed against your real approval process, and
              prototype build starts. By day five: the prototype is
              demonstrated live and recorded, the full report is walked
              through, and the fixed-fee plan for what comes next is on the
              table.

                Say the Sprint recommends an AI Agent Pilot priced at
                $25,000. Your $5,000 Sprint fee is credited in full against
                that price — you pay $20,000 more, $25,000 total. If you
                started with the $1,500 AI Fit Check first, that $1,500 is
                already netted out of the Sprint&apos;s $5,000 fee, so the
                same $25,000 pilot still costs $20,000 more from there. On
                a no-go, none of this applies: no further payment is owed,
                and you keep the Sprint&apos;s deliverables regardless.
