Neither vendor marks its outputs. A fresh hosted-API Cosmos generation hasn't been run yet and is shown as not yet tested.",

General site copy (/, /about, /services, /solutions/oracle and related pages) rebalanced to lead with Fusion Cloud ERP alongside EBS rather than EBS alone; historical changelog entries below and the founder's own biographical EBS/SAP operating history were left untouched as a record of what actually happened, not live positioning.",

Refreshed it with a genuinely current window instead: 16 real calls from Sep 8-9, pulled from the same JARVIS gateway ledger, excluding the gateway's separate claude_max billing pool (personal Claude subscription spend stays private, unlike the shared $30/30-day OpenRouter pool this page documents). The underlying numbers moved a lot since July — real call volume has grown past what the free-tier backends alone can absorb, so this window is 15/16 paid versus the original's 15/17 free. Total spend is still a rounding error against the $30 cap. Reframed the copy on /demos/governance-ledger, /showcase, and /engineering/governance-ledger to tell that real story honestly rather than keep asserting the old free-tier-heavy framing against new data.

Deliberately positioned against, not duplicative of, the two existing self-proof pages: Governance Ledger shows spend-level, per-call rows; Standing Watch walks one incident end-to-end; this page is the aggregate, ongoing record — what a daily automated review found, and what a human approved before anything changed. Shows event-level dispositions, never bare counts or raw logs. Content is real and dated: 11 findings from that day's review, 10 requiring and getting human approval before applying, 1 auto-implemented under a narrow pre-approved bounded-change rule — shown as its own disposition, not folded into a misleading \"0 applied without review.\" Includes one honest example of the review process catching its own mistake (a pre-deploy safety gate flagging its own working code as broken every morning until the review caught why), matching Standing Watch's own precedent of showing failures, not only clean days.

A live functional test the same day found the new email silently never arrived despite a 200 response: appendContactLog() was called fire-and-forget (void) in the API route, the exact pattern the neighboring sendInquiryEmail() call explicitly avoids two lines above with a comment explaining why — Vercel can freeze the serverless execution context the instant the handler returns, cutting off un-awaited async work mid-flight. The slow real SMTP send was reliably long enough to get cut off; the two faster channels before it never showed the bug.
