    heading: "Doesn't ServiceNow's Action Fabric (or SAP's Agent Hub, or Salesforce's MCP servers) already do this?",
    paragraphs: [
      "Partly, and it's worth being precise about which part. ServiceNow's Action Fabric — a GA MCP server bundled into every Now Assist / AI Native SKU — already lets an agent write through ServiceNow's own flows, playbooks, and approvals. SAP ships an equivalent through Agent Hub and Joule Agent Studio's MCP gateway. Salesforce ships hosted MCP servers, GA and free on Enterprise Edition and above, with full user attribution. Inside each vendor's own estate, a governed write already exists.",
      "The write path most buyers actually need crosses that boundary. An agent that qualifies a lead in Salesforce, resolves an AP exception flagged in ServiceNow, or reconciles a PO in SAP frequently needs to write into a different system of record than the one that triggered it — an ERP the triggering platform doesn't own. Action Fabric's approval trail stops at ServiceNow's edge; it doesn't extend into SAP's application logic, and none of these platforms' write paths were built to police a competitor's ledger. That's not a defect — it's the natural limit of a platform vendor governing its own product.",
      "It's also not something a platform vendor can neutrally build past: verifying that a write into a competing ERP was authorized and consistent with that ERP's own controls isn't a capability a platform vendor has an incentive to build well, since it isn't governing its own transaction anymore. This engagement builds the specific write path through the target ERP's own application logic layer — not a database write — with a policy-enforcement gate and an audit-grade evidence trail, regardless of what triggered the write. It's designed to work alongside Action Fabric, Agent Hub, or Salesforce's MCP servers as the trigger or orchestration layer, not to replace them — the gap it closes is the write itself, into the system that actually owns the record.",
      "The same applies to an AI gateway or agent-security control plane you may already run for discovery, identity, policy enforcement, or a kill switch. Keep it. This engagement scopes the write path to sit behind it: the control plane decides whether the agent may act, and the governed write path makes sure the action that reaches the ERP goes through the ERP's own application logic and leaves an evidence record the target system can vouch for. Tioga does not build a gateway or policy engine and does not compete with one; scoping starts with which one you run today.",

  faq: [
    {
      q: "What does \"governed write\" mean technically?",
      a: "The agent never writes directly to the database. It executes through your application's own API/logic layer — the same path a human user's action would take — with a policy-enforcement check and logging before and after.",
    },
    {
      q: "What if the agent gets it wrong?",
      a: "The write path is designed with an explicit rejection and rollback flow from day one, not added after an incident.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is this different from just giving an agent API credentials?",
      a: "API credentials alone don't give you policy enforcement, an approval gate, or an audit trail scoped to what a control owner needs to see. This engagement builds all three around the write, not just the API call.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can we see the audit trail this produces?",
      a: "Yes — see the live Governed AP Exception Workflow demo for the interactive version. This pattern has also run against a real Snowflake sandbox tenant, not just the mock (3 real writes persisted, 2 correctly rejected, full policy-check and audit-trail data on 2026-07-31) — ask and I'll walk you through the real run directly.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does the diagnostic cover payroll/HRIS or FP&A write paths too, or only the ERP?",
      a: "Yes, where a candidate write path originates in or lands in payroll/workforce management or FP&A planning rather than the ERP alone — grounded in hands-on configuration, implementation, and operating experience with UKG Pro and Workday Adaptive Planning (formerly Adaptive Insights, spanning both its pre- and post-Workday-acquisition generations), not a general \"AI in HR\" or \"AI in FP&A\" framework applied from the outside. Two examples: a timecard exception agent proposing punch corrections carries the same attribution-loss risk this diagnostic already looks for on the ERP side — now against real wage-and-hour exposure (FLSA/state overtime rules) rather than only a posting-period control; a headcount-forecast drafting agent has to write into a draft, never a locked/approved, version, with each number tagged to its source data and stated assumption. Any demo shown ahead of a live engagement runs on synthetic data — UKG doesn't issue developer sandboxes outside its formal partner program, and Adaptive Planning sandboxes come bundled with a customer license — stated plainly, not implied away.",
