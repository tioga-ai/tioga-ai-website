  problem:
    "Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP ships real REST APIs and its own AI Agent Studio — but its native agents don't give you one audit trail spanning your Fusion agents and everything else in your stack. EBS is the harder case: custom APIs, HTTP-Basic-Auth-only integration, and a security model that predates agentic AI mean most \"AI for ERP\" vendors stop at read-only dashboards.",
  outcome:
    "A governed AI agent running inside your Fusion Cloud ERP or EBS environment — reading real REST resources or modules, executing through your application's own logic layer, with one audit trail your control owners can review across both.",
