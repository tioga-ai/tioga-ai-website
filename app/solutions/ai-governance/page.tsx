    heading: "Why not just use what ServiceNow, SAP, or Salesforce already ship?",
    paragraphs: [
      "It's a fair question, and worth answering directly instead of deflecting. ServiceNow ships Action Fabric — a GA MCP server bundled into every Now Assist / AI Native SKU — that routes external agent actions through ServiceNow's own flows, playbooks, and approvals, and its AI Control Tower now ships pre-built EU AI Act, California AI Act, and Colorado AI Act compliance content, cross-mapped to NIST AI RMF. SAP ships its own Agent Hub, Joule Agent Studio, and an MCP gateway. Salesforce ships hosted MCP servers, GA and free on Enterprise Edition and above, with full user attribution. All three are real, shipped, and genuinely useful inside their own estate.",
      "The gap is structural, not a missing feature they'll ship next quarter: each of these tools governs the platform it ships with, not the agents running elsewhere in your stack. ServiceNow's own published materials put closed platforms like SAP on its discovery list — something it can see — not its observability list — something it actively governs. An SAP Agent Hub control has no visibility into a ServiceNow-routed action, and a Salesforce MCP attribution log doesn't reach an agent acting inside Oracle or Workday. Run two or more of these platforms — most mid-market and enterprise estates do — and you end up with two or three well-built, non-overlapping panes of glass, and still no single record of what any agent did, under what policy, with what human approval, across the aggregate.",
      "There's a second reason this isn't a build-it-yourself gap: a platform vendor can't neutrally referee a spend or workload decision between itself and a competitor's platform sitting in the same estate. If ServiceNow's agent economics compete for the same budget or workflow as a Salesforce or SAP agent, ServiceNow's own tooling has no incentive to surface that trade-off honestly — and the reverse is equally true. That's not an accusation of bad faith; it's a structural conflict of interest built into who's asking the question. Governance that spans platforms has to sit above all of them, held by a party with no stake in which platform wins the budget.",
      "That's the layer Tioga builds: an aggregation and verification layer that consumes what ServiceNow, SAP, and Salesforce already produce — their own discovery, risk-rating, and observability data — as inputs, and adds what none of them do on their own: policy translation across all three to one framework set (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, the EU AI Act), a cross-vendor spend and workload arbitration baseline, and a single composed record tying a specific agent's action to the specific policy version and the specific human approval behind it, regardless of which platform the agent ran on. If you already run one of these platforms, keep it — this doesn't replace it. It's what makes three separate platform-native governance panes add up to one governed estate instead of three.",
