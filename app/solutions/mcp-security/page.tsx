    "Security and compliance reviewers evaluating an MCP-based AI integration who need to know what's actually enforced — not just what protocol it technically supports.",
  problem:
    "MCP standardizes how an agent talks to a tool, and its own spec does define an OAuth-based authorization flow — but that flow is optional, many servers skip it, and even a compliant one only answers \"can this client reach this server,\" not \"should this specific action be approved\" or \"log this decision.\" Tool-level permissions, call-level audit logging, and approval policy still have to be built around it. Vendors selling \"MCP integration\" rarely address any of that.",
  outcome:
    "An MCP integration with scoped permissions per tool, call-level audit logging, and policy enforcement — reviewed the way your security team actually reviews a system, not glossed over as \"it's just an API.\"",
