          <p>
            I&apos;m the founder of Tioga AI. I spent decades on the
            operating side of enterprise systems — Oracle EBS, SAP, finance,
            HR, procurement, and the governance and compliance work that keeps
            all of it audit-ready. Not consulting from the outside: running it.
            That operating experience includes UKG Pro on the payroll and
            workforce side, and Workday Adaptive Planning — formerly Adaptive
            Insights, spanning both the pre- and post-Workday-acquisition
            generations of the product — on the FP&A side, in each case
            across configuration, implementation, and ongoing operation, not
            a vendor-partner or advisory role.
          </p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s the terrain I&apos;m building AI agents on now. Most AI
            vendors can demo a chatbot; few have ever had to reconcile a
            general ledger, navigate an ERP&apos;s custom auth layer, or sit
            in a compliance review. Tioga AI exists because that gap — between
            AI that looks impressive and AI that survives contact with a real
            enterprise system — is exactly where I&apos;ve spent my career.
            Before founding Tioga AI, I managed the governance work that
            keeps ERP, HR, and CRM systems audit-ready across four sister
            companies — not AI-specific compliance theory, the actual
            operating discipline this practice is built on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tioga AI is a principal-led practice: the person who scopes your
            engagement is the person who does the engineering and prepares
            the evidence your control owners review. Every live demo on this
            site is code I wrote and infrastructure I run —
            including the governance ledger, which isn&apos;t a mockup but a
            real excerpt from the routing gateway this business runs on
            internally. What you see here is what shipped, not what&apos;s planned.

        {/* Accountability: what verification looks like for a principal-led,
            not-yet-named practice — direct engagement and demonstrated work
            you can check yourself, not a bio you have to take on faith.
            Replaces a prior block that dwelt on what's missing from this
            page; the practice is still not naming individuals publicly at
            this stage, but that's a framing choice, not something to
            explain or apologize for. */}

            Every engagement is scoped, built, and delivered by the same

            The systems your business runs on today — the ERP, the CRM, the
            HRIS — are not the problem. They&apos;re the asset. Tioga AI builds
            AI agents that connect to them as they are, with governance
            controls designed in from the start, instead of asking you to
            replace what already works. Those controls persist, too — every
            agent retains your approval chains and policy context run over
            run, instead of re-learning your environment from a blank slate
            every session, the way a generic chatbot tool does.
