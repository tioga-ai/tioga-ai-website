// HONESTY BOUNDARY (load-bearing — do not extend without re-verifying):
// the write-capable capability LIST below (§A1) is a verbatim TOC extraction
// covering all of SAP's own S/4HANA Cloud "Transactional Capabilities"
// pages — that part is a real inventory, not an example. The GATE DETAIL
// (scope item / business catalog / caps / confirmation) is verified this
// deeply for exactly TWO agents — Production Planning and Operations (§A2,
// S/4HANA) and Concur Expense (see below, added 2026-08-22, a different
// product line under the same "Joule" brand). An earlier draft of Tioga's
// own LinkedIn content overclaimed that every capability was gated this
// same specific way and was corrected after independent review found only
// one agent's gates were actually checked this closely (see
// strategy/2026-08-20-linkedin-sap-joule-capability-gap-drafts.md).
// Don't repeat that mistake here: this demo shows real worked gate
// examples for the capabilities actually checked, not a fabricated gate
// for every capability.

// Concur Expense gate source: SAP Concur PUBLIC FAQ "Joule with SAP Concur

// §1 Claim 3 and §3.1. Currency caveat carried from that research: the FAQ
// predates SAP's March 2026 Concur Fusion announcement, which adds two new
// agents (Expense Automation Agent, Expense Pre-Submit Audit Agent) still
// in Early Adopter Care as of the research date — those two are NOT
// included below since they're not yet GA. Re-verify before extending
