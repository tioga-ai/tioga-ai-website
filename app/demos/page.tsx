// Server-rendered shell added 2026-09-02 (2026-09-02 comprehensive
// business-readiness audit, G-43/G-50): this page was previously 100%
// client-rendered ("use client" at the top of what's now DemosClient.tsx)
// -- server HTML was ~330 characters of layout/footer with the entire
// body left as an unresolved streaming placeholder. Any crawler that
// doesn't execute JS (which includes most LLM/AI-search crawlers) saw an
// empty page behind the nav item labelled "Live Demos." This file is now
// a real Server Component: it renders genuine static content (the same
// four demos already described in plain text on the homepage's "Try It
// Right Now" section) before handing off to DemosClient for the actual
// interactive experience. No change to DemosClient's behavior --
// identical file, just moved and renamed so it can be wrapped by a server
// parent instead of being the route's own entry point.
