// Free, rules-based self-check on ONE agent-to-ERP/CRM write path. Every

// attribution, policy, approval, verification, rollback, evidence, owner,
// change control) — deliberately not a maturity questionnaire about the
// organization. Authored rules, no model call, nothing leaves the browser.
//
// Scoring principle (same as the Fusion readiness fix, 2026-09-19): an
// unanswered/"Not sure" control is UNCONFIRMED, never counted as exposed.
// "Yes" is self-reported and unaudited — the page says so.

    whyItMatters:
      "A shared or borrowed credential means the system of record cannot tell an agent's write from a person's, and one leaked credential exposes every workflow that uses it.",
    firstStep: "Issue a dedicated, revocable identity for this agent and inventory who else uses the credential it uses today.",
  },
  {
    id: "least-privilege",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "Is that identity limited to the specific objects and actions this workflow needs, rather than a broad role?",
    whyItMatters:
      "A broad role turns a wrong or manipulated instruction into a wrong write anywhere the role reaches, not just in the intended workflow.",
    firstStep: "List the exact objects and actions the workflow performs and cut the role down to that list.",
  },
  {
    id: "app-logic",
    weight: "core",
    ask: "Do writes go through the system's own API or business-logic layer — the same path a human action takes — rather than direct database changes or UI scripting?",
    whyItMatters:
      "Bypassing the application's own validation and posting logic skips the rules the ERP or CRM already enforces, so a write can be accepted that the system itself would have rejected.",
    firstStep: "Identify the one sanctioned application-logic write path for this workflow and route the agent through it.",
  },
  {
    id: "attribution",
    weight: "core",
    ask: "When a record changes, does the system's own audit log show that the agent did it, and on whose behalf?",
    whyItMatters:
      "If the native audit trail records only a generic integration user, an auditor cannot reconstruct who or what authorised a specific change from the system itself.",
    firstStep: "Check one recent agent write in the system's own audit log and see what it actually records about the actor.",
  },
  {
    id: "policy",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "Is there a policy check before each write — limits, vendor or account status, period open, duplicates — that can block it?",
    whyItMatters:
      "Without a pre-write check, controls that depend on a person noticing (a held vendor, a closed period, a duplicate) are silently skipped when an agent acts.",
    firstStep: "Write down the three checks a careful human applies before this write and make them a blocking rule.",
  },
  {
    id: "approval",
    weight: "core",
    ask: "Does a write above a defined threshold require a named human approval before it commits?",
    whyItMatters:
      "Without an approval gate, the largest or most unusual writes have the same authority as routine ones, and no named person is accountable for them.",
    firstStep: "Define the threshold and the named approver for it, and make the write wait for that approval.",
  },
  {
    id: "denial",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "Is the behavior defined when an approval is denied or times out — no silent retry, no auto-approve?",
    whyItMatters:
      "An approval gate that fails open on timeout or retries after denial is not a gate; the undefined case is where these controls usually break.",
    firstStep: "Specify denial and timeout outcomes explicitly (stop, escalate, or expire) and test each one.",
  },
  {
    id: "verification",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "After a write, does something re-read the system state and confirm it matches what was intended?",
    whyItMatters:
      "A success response from an API is not proof the record ended up correct; without a read-back, partial or wrong writes are found later by someone else.",
    firstStep: "Add a read-back step that compares the resulting record with the intended change and flags any difference.",
  },
  {
    id: "rollback",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "Is there a tested way to reverse a wrong write (a reversal entry, void, or restore)?",
    whyItMatters:
      "An untested rollback is a plan, not a control; the first real wrong write is a bad time to discover it does not work.",
    firstStep: "Run one deliberate wrong write in a sandbox and reverse it end to end.",
  },
  {
    id: "evidence",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "For any single write, can you produce one record showing what was proposed, which policy ran, who approved it, and what happened?",
    whyItMatters:
      "Auditors and control owners ask for the story of one transaction. If it has to be pieced together from several systems, it usually cannot be reproduced on demand.",
    firstStep: "Pick one write from last month and try to assemble that record; note every gap.",
  },
  {
    id: "owner",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "Is there a named person accountable for this agent's write access, with a review date and the authority to revoke it?",
    whyItMatters:
      "Agent access with no owner outlives the project that created it and is rarely reviewed.",
    firstStep: "Name an owner, set a review cadence, and record how access is revoked.",
  },

    id: "change-control",
    weight: "supporting",
    ask: "Is a change to the agent's instructions, tools, or model reviewed before it can change what the agent is allowed to write?",
    whyItMatters:
      "A prompt or tool change can quietly widen what the agent does; if changes are not reviewed, yesterday's approval no longer describes today's agent.",
    firstStep: "Put agent instruction, tool, and model changes through the same review as a permission change.",
