// Full methodology + raw outputs: ~/MarbleTrial/ (marble_trial.py, measure.html,
// runs/20260821T222610Z/). See the local Claude memory store/

  "Every number on this page came from an actual run against World Labs' World API, not a mocked or illustrative scenario — 2 real generations (~$2.40), a byte-level provenance scan of every exported file, and a real two-point measurement against a physical reference. The test harness itself had 3 real integration bugs along the way (API response fields didn't match assumed names) — all caught and fixed by running it, not by reading documentation alone.";
