// Cross-vendor evidence-composition demo. A genuinely different shape from
// the other two governed write-path demos: this one isn't about a policy
// deciding auto/escalate/block on a single write path. It's about what
// happens *after* a write path already executed cleanly — because it spans
// TWO systems that each only log their own half of the story, an
// after-the-fact audit question ("who authorized this, and does the record
// prove it matches what actually happened?") is unanswerable from either
// system alone.
//
// Grounded in Tioga's most-corroborated competitive finding: a universal AI
// assistant (Claude/ChatGPT-class, the conversational/orchestration layer)
// logs the conversation and intent; an ERP vendor's own execution agent (an
// SAP-Joule-style layer) logs the transaction. Neither composes the two into
// one attributable record — see
// ~/SecondBrain/TiogaAI/competitive/erp-vendor-agent-layers.md ("What
// neither vendor is building") and
// ~/SecondBrain/TiogaAI/sales/proposals/11-agent-ready-erp-diagnostic.md's
// "evidence composition" axis. SAP's own June 2026 reference architecture
// for third-party MCP access states the MCP protocol specification is still maturing, with security,
// identity and governance requirements for enterprise deployments "not yet fully addressed" — a vendor-authored admission
// of exactly this gap, not a claim Tioga is inventing.
//
// Same order (SO-4471) and semiconductor capital-equipment framing as the
// other demos and
// ~/SecondBrain/TiogaAI/sales/case-study-semiconductor-capital-equipment-sap-oracle-governance.md
// — illustrative composite scenario, not a real client engagement, matching
// the same honesty rule those demos already carry.
//
// No real vendor names are used in a way that implies partnership or
// endorsement — "a universal AI assistant" and "an ERP vendor's own
// execution agent" are generic throughout, matching the rest of this site's
// existing convention (grep confirms no other page/demo names "Joule" or a
// specific ERP-vendor agent product).
