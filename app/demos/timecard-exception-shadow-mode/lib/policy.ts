//
// This applies offer #11's existing "shadow-mode before cutover" delivery
// standard — an agent proposes, never auto-executes, runs for a defined
// window, and cutover to live execution is gated on measured agreement
// between what it proposed and what a human reviewer actually decided, not
// a calendar date — to a payroll/timecard write path instead of an ERP
// write path. See sales/proposals/11-agent-ready-erp-diagnostic.md,
// "Delivery standard: shadow-mode before cutover." Every proposal below is
// logged only; nothing here ever executes a real payroll write.
//
// 100% SYNTHETIC DATA. Every employee, punch, and exception below is
// invented for this demo. None of it is connected to, sourced from, or
// shaped against any real UKG tenant, sandbox, or export — Tioga has no
// UKG vendor credentials or sandbox access. The FLSA/state wage-and-hour
// rules cited are real statutes/regulations, cited illustratively to show
// the *class* of check a timecard-exception agent should run — this is not
// legal advice and not a substitute for counsel on any real pay decision.
