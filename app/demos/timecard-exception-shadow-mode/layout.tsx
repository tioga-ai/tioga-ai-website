    "An agent reviews synthetic timecard exceptions — missed punches, late punches, unapproved overtime, PTO requests — and proposes a correction or approval for each, citing the named payroll-cycle control and FLSA/state wage-and-hour rule behind it. Shadow-mode only: it never auto-executes. See how a simulated agreement rate moves against seeded reviewer decisions in a synthetic review window. 100% synthetic data.",
