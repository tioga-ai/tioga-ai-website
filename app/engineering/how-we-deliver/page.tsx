              How Tioga builds is what Tioga sells, and that is an operating
              fact, not a claim. Tioga&apos;s own delivery estate — the AI
              automation that runs Tioga&apos;s day-to-day operations — runs
              under propose-and-approve, with capability-absence and runtime
              deny lists ranked above documentation as enforcement, read-only
              agent types, root-originated delegation, and scheduled
              verification of what its own automations claim against what
              they actually produced. A prospect who asks &quot;do you
              actually work this way?&quot; can be shown the deny lists, the
              agent-type definitions, the verification jobs, and Tioga&apos;s
              own dated incident records — real, found-and-fixed gaps in
              Tioga&apos;s own infrastructure, not a single curated write-up.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-[var(--text-muted)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Every client engagement below is built to be executed under
              that same discipline going forward: Tioga sells one thing in
              sixteen shapes — the connection between agent behavior,
              governance evidence, and the enterprise transaction itself. An
              assessment sells that connection as a map. A pilot or
              write-path build sells it as running, evidenced software. A
              governance program sells it as a control system with an audit
              trail. A retainer sells it as a standing watch. Every offer has
              the same job: produce that connection, with evidence a control
              owner can inspect.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-[var(--text-muted)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In practice: Tioga writes the spec, scoped sub-agents do
              bounded work under least-privilege grants, a human gate sits in
              front of anything that touches a client system, and a
              reconciliation pass runs on schedule.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-[var(--text-muted)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Evidence over assertion, applied to Tioga first: a control you
              cannot produce evidence for is not a control. Tioga has no
              client case studies and does not manufacture composite ones
              that read as real. It offers instead a bounded fixed-fee
              sprint, a working prototype the prospect can break, explicit
              go/no-go gates, and a methodology the prospect can read before
              they read a price. Every phase below ends with an artifact, and
              the artifact is the exit criterion. &quot;We are confident&quot;
              is never a gate condition; &quot;here is the agreement report,
              signed by your controller&quot; is.

              , and a no-go finding out of that sprint is a first-class
              deliverable, not a failed sale. The client keeps all work
              product at every gate whether or not they continue. Tioga is
              never a required runtime dependency: production credentials,
              repositories, logs, and deployment assets stay under the
              client&apos;s control from the first day, and the handover
              phase exists to prove that, not merely promise it. Fixed fees
              have teeth in both directions: named deliverables, named
              exclusions, objective acceptance criteria, a capped
              change-order mechanism, and milestone payments tied to
              accepted outputs.

              Tioga is a principal-led practice by design, not by apology. One person

              constraint the methodology below is built to make workable at

                  An inbound contact resolves within five business days into
                  one of three outcomes: a Discovery Sprint order, a polite
                  disqualification, or a logged candidate need that no
                  current offer covers. A single 30-45 minute triage call
                  establishes what the pain actually is (automation, an
                  agent that needs to reach a system of record, or answering
                  for AI already in production), what made it urgent now,
                  who signs and who has to be satisfied the result is
                  controlled, which system of record is in play, and how far
                  along the client already is. That produces a starting
                  hypothesis for which offer fits — the Discovery
                  Sprint&apos;s job is then to confirm or overturn it. A
                  Discovery Sprint that ends in &quot;you asked for a pilot;
                  the honest answer is a governance readiness assessment
                  first&quot; is a success, and the $5,000 fee credits toward

                  Tioga to hold production credentials or act as a runtime

                  owner, the systems owner, the control owner, and the
                  sponsor. A current-state system and control map is built,
                  showing where evidence already exists and where it&apos;s
                  missing. Three to five candidate use cases are scored on

                  high-value, uncontrollable use case is not a candidate for
                  a first pilot. One use case is selected with the sponsor,

                  session with the sponsor and control owner present: the
                  Discovery Report is walked through, the prototype is
                  demonstrated live and recorded, and a fixed-fee pilot plan
                  is presented with named deliverables, exclusions,
                  acceptance criteria, and price. The client leaves with
                  everything.

              Every engagement, regardless of offer, produces evidence
              against the three delivery standards at every phase. Where an
              offer has no built agent — a pure governance assessment — the
              standards still apply to Tioga&apos;s own delivery process,
              and the client-facing artifacts describe the client&apos;s
              agents rather than Tioga&apos;s.

              <strong style={{ color: "var(--text)" }}>The evidence ledger.</strong> Opened
              at first contact, append-only, one row per artifact or event:
              date, what, where it lives, who produced it, who verified it,
              who signed it. This is the backbone of the evidence pack, and
              it&apos;s also the artifact Tioga would hand to its own
              auditor, or to a client who asks &quot;show me how you
              worked&quot; — it has to be able to bear that reading.

              <strong style={{ color: "var(--text)" }}>What counts as evidence.</strong> An
              artifact only counts as evidence in a Tioga engagement if it
              is attributable (names a human or an agent type, never
              &quot;the system&quot;); timestamped at creation and immutable
              or versioned thereafter; reproducible (a control owner can
              re-run the check and get the same result, without Tioga);
              located (a path, a system, an owner, a retention period); and
              tied to a framework reference where one applies, or listed as
              a gap where it doesn&apos;t yet have one. Anything that fails
              one of these is recorded, but as a claim — not as evidence.
