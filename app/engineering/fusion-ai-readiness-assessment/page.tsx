          Given a description of an Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP environment —
          target agent use case, transaction volume, integration method, and
          which governance controls already exist — produce a readiness
          score, named gaps, and a recommended approach. Retired and rebuilt
          2026-09-10 from the site&apos;s prior Oracle EBS → S/4HANA
          migration-complexity demo, which answered a different question
          (should you leave EBS) than this one does (is it safe to run
          governed AI agents against the Fusion Cloud ERP environment you
          already have) — same reasoning-model scaffolding, new domain.

            <p className="text-sm text-[var(--text-muted)] leading-relaxed">
              The system prompt frames Claude as a senior AI-governance
              architect and explicitly instructs it to reference real Fusion
              Cloud ERP concepts for the use case actually selected —
              Payables invoice holds and matching for AP exceptions,
              supplier and purchase-order approval for procurement triage,
              chart-of-accounts and period-close controls for GL review —
              rather than returning generic AI-governance advice that would
              apply to any input. Each governance control is marked Present,
              Absent, or Unknown (the default), and the prompt keeps those
              apart. One conditional line does real work: if fewer than two
              controls are confirmed present and at least one is confirmed
              absent, the prompt requires the response to call that out as a
              structural blocker to autonomous agent action, not a minor
              gap to note in passing. Unknown controls are never described
              as missing and never trigger that verdict on their own; they
              come back as items to confirm, with a provisional score.

              This is the one demo on the site running Claude Sonnet 5 with
              extended thinking explicitly disabled — the reasoning load
              (weighing use case against transaction volume against which
              governance controls already exist to produce a specific,
              defensible recommendation) is real, but this use case
              doesn&apos;t need multi-step deliberation to get there. It also
              gets the tightest rate limit on the site — 5 requests per 10
              minutes per IP, against 30 requests per day for the extraction
              demos — because a reasoning-model call costs meaningfully more
              than a Haiku extraction call, and a public demo endpoint has
              to assume it will be hit by more than curious visitors.
