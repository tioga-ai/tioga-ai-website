          Most demos on this site take an input and run it through
          a model live. This one doesn&apos;t take an input at all — it&apos;s a
          real, dated excerpt from the routing ledger that Tioga&apos;s own AI
          infrastructure (JARVIS) writes to on every call it makes, anywhere,
          for any purpose. The interesting engineering here isn&apos;t a
          prompt; it&apos;s what the ledger had to look like for this page to
          be honest.

              The 16-row ledger and the &quot;live gateway snapshot&quot; stats above
              it are hardcoded, dated, and captured at two different times
              (the ledger rows span Sep 8–9, the snapshot is Sep 9) rather
              than fetched from a live endpoint on page load. That&apos;s a
              deliberate tradeoff, not a shortcut: a public demo page that
              live-queries an internal cost/routing gateway is an unnecessary
              exposed surface for zero real benefit — visitors don&apos;t need
              millisecond freshness on someone else&apos;s infrastructure spend,
              they need to see the shape of what gets logged. The two
              timestamps are labeled separately in the UI instead of merged
              into one implied &quot;live&quot; number, so the distinction between
              &quot;real excerpt&quot; and &quot;real-time&quot; stays honest rather than
              blurred for effect.

              GOVERN / MAP / MEASURE / MANAGE aren&apos;t a label applied to this
              page after the fact — they&apos;re fields the gateway already
              records on every call: <code className="text-xs px-1 py-0.5 rounded" style={{ background: "var(--bg-card)" }}>policy: budget.json</code> for
              GOVERN, <code className="text-xs px-1 py-0.5 rounded" style={{ background: "var(--bg-card)" }}>model → served_model</code> for
              MAP, token/cost/quality fields for MEASURE, and a
              reserve-then-charge budget check for MANAGE. The page just
              renders what the ledger schema already tracked. That ordering
              matters for the offers this demo backs (governed ERP write-path,
              insurance-underwriting evidence, cost/model governance
              assessments) — the pitch is that governance evidence is a
              byproduct of how the infrastructure is built, not a report
              generated to satisfy an auditor after the fact.

            <p className="text-sm text-[var(--text-muted)] leading-relaxed">
              This window looks different from the one this page originally
              shipped with (captured Jul 2026), and that difference is the
              point, not an embarrassment to hide. Back then, most calls
              resolved to a free local/Google backend before touching billed
              credit. By Sep 8–9, real call volume has grown past what those
              free backends alone can absorb, so {PAID_COUNT} of the {TOTAL_CALLS} rows in this
              window route to paid OpenRouter backends
              (<code className="text-xs px-1 py-0.5 rounded" style={{ background: "var(--bg-card)" }}>glm-5.2</code>,{" "}
              <code className="text-xs px-1 py-0.5 rounded" style={{ background: "var(--bg-card)" }}>gpt-terra</code>) —
              only {FREE_ZERO_COST_COUNT} of {TOTAL_CALLS} ({FREE_ZERO_COST_PCT}%) still settle at exactly $0 in this
              particular window. The mechanism hasn&apos;t changed: every
              request still records what was requested and what actually
              served it, and the routing policy still tries free/cheap
              backends first — it&apos;s just that there&apos;s more real traffic
              now than the free tier alone covers. Total spend for this
              16-call window is still a rounding error against the $30 cap
              (see the strip above), which is the actual claim this page
              makes — not that free tier absorbs everything forever.

              Every other demo on this site accepts either a constrained form
              or a file upload, and the corresponding writeup spends real
              space on how untrusted input is validated before it reaches a
              model. This page has no input field and calls no model at
              request time — it renders a static array shipped in the page
              bundle. There&apos;s nothing to sanitize because there&apos;s no path
              from a visitor&apos;s browser to a prompt at all. That&apos;s not a
              gap in this demo; it&apos;s the correct shape for what it&apos;s
              actually demonstrating — operational governance data, not a
              live inference endpoint.
