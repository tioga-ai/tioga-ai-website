        <Section title="The short version">
          <p>
            This page describes, plainly, what actually happens to data you
            submit on tioga.ai — the contact form and the live AI demos. Tioga
            AI is a principal-led practice; there is no marketing database, no ad
            tracking, and no resale of your data to anyone. What we collect,
            we collect to respond to you or to run the demo you asked to see.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="What this page doesn't cover yet">
          <p>
            Stated plainly rather than left implicit: this page has not yet
            been reviewed by an attorney for GDPR- or CCPA-specific
            requirements — for example, whether Tioga AI needs to designate
            an EU representative, what data-transfer mechanism applies to
            submissions from the EEA/UK/Switzerland, or a formal process for
            California-resident rights requests beyond emailing us directly.
            We&apos;d rather say that plainly than assert a specific legal
            position here that hasn&apos;t actually been reviewed. If you&apos;re
            submitting data from a jurisdiction where that matters — or your
            organization needs a reviewed DPA before you engage with
            us — email{" "}
            <a href="mailto:hello@tioga.ai" className="underline hover:text-[var(--text)] transition-colors">
              hello@tioga.ai
            </a>{" "}
            before submitting anything through this Site.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="What we collect and why">
          <p>
            <strong style={{ color: "var(--text)" }}>Contact form.</strong> When you
            submit the form on the{" "}
            <a href="/contact" className="underline hover:text-[var(--text)] transition-colors">
              Contact page
            </a>{" "}
            (name, company, email, project
            description), that text is sent to Anthropic&apos;s Claude API to
            classify the inquiry (urgency, service fit, suggested next step),
            and the submission plus that classification is emailed to Tioga
            AI&apos;s founder so we can respond to you. It is not written to a
            database on our side — the email inbox is the record.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong style={{ color: "var(--text)" }}>Live demos.</strong> Text or files
            you paste or upload into the invoice processing, email triage,
            document classification, or Fusion AI-readiness assessment demos are sent
            to Claude to generate the result shown on screen, and are not
            stored by Tioga AI afterward — not in a database, not in a log, not
            emailed to us. Once the response is returned to your browser, Tioga
            AI keeps no copy of what you submitted. Anthropic handles the text
            under its own retention terms (see Third Parties below).

            </strong>{" "}
            If you optionally enter an email address on that demo, it is used
            once, in memory, to send that one assessment to you by email — it
            is not logged, written to a database, or sent to us. See Third
            Parties below for the mail provider that transmits it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong style={{ color: "var(--text)" }}>Chat widget.</strong> Messages you
            send to the chat assistant are sent to Claude to generate a reply
            and are not stored after your browser session ends.

            to be notified when it updates, that address is emailed directly
            to Tioga AI&apos;s founder — the same inbox-as-record approach as
            the contact form. We don&apos;t use a mailing-list or email-marketing
            service for this; there is no automated newsletter, and no
            third party other than our email provider (see Third Parties
            below) ever receives the address.

            service, in a new tab or embedded widget. Any name, email, and
            scheduling details you provide there are collected and processed
            by Cal.com directly, under its own privacy policy — not by this
            Site. See Third Parties below.

            <strong style={{ color: "var(--text)" }}>Basic request metadata.</strong> To
            prevent abuse of the contact form and demo endpoints, we
            rate-limit by IP address. That count is held in server memory
            temporarily and is not linked to your name or email.
