            documentation — the adapter Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) uses
            to reach EBS, and the same adapter Oracle&apos;s own reference
            architecture for AI-agent access routes through — states,
            verbatim: &ldquo;HTTP Basic Authentication is the only supported
            authentication security for REST services in this release.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            The username and password are set once, on the adapter
            connection itself, and passed through at runtime for every
            call. That means the credential actually reaching EBS is a
            single, static, shared service account — identical for every
            request, whether it was triggered by one employee, a different
            employee, or an autonomous agent acting on either one&apos;s
            behalf.

          whatever identity authenticated the call. On this path, that
          identity is always the integration account, never the human who
          asked or the agent that acted. An agent could execute a real
          write inside EBS through Oracle&apos;s own sanctioned interface,
          and EBS&apos;s own evidence trail would show the same generic
          service account it shows for every other integration call ever
          made through that connection — a present-tense limitation in
          shipped Oracle documentation, not a roadmap gap Oracle has

            routing a Fusion AI Agent through OIC&apos;s hosted MCP server
            and this same EBS Adapter — explicitly &ldquo;the proposed
            pattern,&rdquo; in Oracle&apos;s own words, not a shipped
            product. The only capability it actually demonstrates is a{" "}
            <strong style={{ color: "var(--text)" }}>read</strong>: a single
            identity lookup, in 6.24 seconds. Oracle&apos;s own adoption
            guidance describes usage expanding &ldquo;as tool contracts,
            approval rules, and observability mature&rdquo; — Oracle
            conceding, in its own materials, that those three aren&apos;t
            mature yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two honest caveats worth carrying alongside the finding above,
            so this doesn&apos;t overstate the case: identity propagation
            does appear to be possible on other OIC adapters, and EBS&apos;s
            own Integrated SOA Gateway reportedly supports token-based
            authentication in addition to Basic Auth. Neither was
            independently verified end-to-end for this piece. That cuts the
            other way from a marketing claim — it means the constraint
            described above is a property of the specific adapter and
            integration path Oracle&apos;s own reference architecture uses
            today, not an unfixable law of EBS itself. It&apos;s an argument
            for building a better path deliberately, not evidence the gap
            is already closed.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the write side specifically, this adapter reaches PL/SQL
            APIs, concurrent programs, Java/OAF services, and interface
            tables — but not Oracle Forms, <code>CUSTOM.pll</code>, or Forms
            personalizations, where a large share of a customized R12
            instance&apos;s real validation logic actually lives. Whether a
            given write is fully governed ends up depending on which
            interface an integration admin chose to expose, and whether its
            validation chain actually matches the one your Forms UI
            enforces — instance-specific configuration knowledge no Oracle
            product resolves for you.

        <p>
          Worth stating plainly, since it&apos;s easy to read the finding
          above as a knock on Oracle generally rather than on this specific
          adapter and integration path: Oracle&apos;s newer Fusion Cloud ERP
          doesn&apos;t share this constraint. Fusion is REST-native — its own
          documented REST resources (Payables invoices and invoice holds
          among them) sit behind Oracle Cloud Security Roles rather than a
          single Basic-Auth service account, and Oracle ships a real AI Agent
          Studio built directly against those APIs. That doesn&apos;t make
          attribution automatic — a Fusion deployment still has to actually
          configure agent-scoped roles and an exported audit trail rather
          than defaulting to broad access — but the ceiling is structurally
          higher: nothing about Fusion&apos;s own REST surface forces every
          agent call through one shared identity the way EBS&apos;s adapter
          does today. See the{" "}

          &ldquo;Governed by the vendor&rdquo; and &ldquo;attributable to a
          specific actor&rdquo; are two different claims, and it&apos;s
          worth asking any vendor — Oracle included — which one they&apos;re
          actually making for a given integration path. A written policy
          about who&apos;s allowed to do what is necessary but not
          sufficient if the system underneath it can&apos;t distinguish one
