        <p>
          Model Context Protocol solves a real, narrow problem: it gives an
          AI agent one consistent way to call into Workday, Salesforce, SAP,
          or any other system, instead of a bespoke integration per system per
          agent. That&apos;s a genuine engineering win — it&apos;s not a
          governance win by itself, and pitches that imply MCP alone
          &ldquo;replaces integrations&rdquo; or removes the need for
          controls are overstating what the protocol does.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      heading: "What still has to be built underneath it",
      body: (
        <>
          <p>
            My own MCP demo enforces a per-IP rate limit (20 requests per 24 hours, held in server memory)
            on the endpoint before a single call reaches the model — a basic
            control an MCP connection doesn&apos;t give you automatically.
            The system prompt also requires the model to return which
            specific tool it called and with what data, in a structured
            format the application parses back out — so &ldquo;the agent
            answered a question&rdquo; is always paired with &ldquo;here is
            exactly which system record it touched to answer it.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither of those is an MCP feature. They&apos;re governance
            decisions that have to be made explicitly, the same way they
            would for a hand-rolled REST integration — MCP standardizes the
            wire format, not the authorization model on top of it.
          </p>
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      heading: "The question to actually ask a vendor",
      body: (
        <p>
          Not &ldquo;do you support MCP&rdquo; — almost everyone will soon.
          Ask what happens when the agent asks for something out of its
          granted scope, what the rate and spend ceilings are, and what
          evidence exists after the fact showing which tool call produced
          which answer. If the answer is &ldquo;MCP handles that,&rdquo; it
          doesn&apos;t — the protocol carries the request, not the policy.
