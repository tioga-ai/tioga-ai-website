          <p>
            If your company runs SAP, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Snowflake, or
            Workday, an AI lab is already running inside at least one of them
            — and you didn&apos;t sign that contract. Each of these vendors
            independently decided which large language model to build its
            agent features on, over roughly the same twelve months, largely
            without coordinating with each other or announcing it as a single
            industry moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s not a criticism of any one vendor&apos;s choice. It&apos;s
            a fact about your risk surface that&apos;s easy to miss when each
            announcement lands separately, months apart, from a different
            vendor&apos;s press office.

            Run SAP and Salesforce together, and you&apos;re touching
            Anthropic through two separate contracts you never signed with
            Anthropic. Add Snowflake, and it&apos;s a third. None of these
            platforms&apos; own governance consoles see past their own walls
            — SAP&apos;s agent-governance tooling can&apos;t see what&apos;s
            running inside Salesforce, and Salesforce&apos;s audit trail
            can&apos;t see SAP.

          <p>
            Microsoft&apos;s Agent 365 is a genuinely useful registry of
            which agents exist and how they&apos;re configured inside the
            Microsoft estate, and it can quarantine unsanctioned ones there.
            What it doesn&apos;t answer is which
            model lab sits under which vendor contract, on what data terms,
            or what your combined exposure looks like if one of those labs
            changes its terms — a different question, and one Microsoft has
            its own stake in either lab&apos;s answer to.

            None of this means any of these AI-vendor choices are wrong. It
            means the aggregate view — what you&apos;re actually running,
            across every vendor, under whose contract — isn&apos;t something
            any single platform is positioned to hand you.
