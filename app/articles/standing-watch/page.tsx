        <p>
          My AI estate runs across two machines talking to five different
          backends. Before security-watch existed, I hit the failure mode
          it was built to catch: an authentication fix was applied and
          verified on one machine, and quietly never made it to the second.
          Nobody was lying about the system&apos;s state — nobody was
          checking both machines identically, on a schedule. It drifted,
          unauthenticated, for more than 12 days before anything caught it.
        </p>
      ),

    {
      heading: "The fix isn't a smarter check — it's the same check, everywhere, on a schedule",
      body: (
        <p>
          Security-watch runs one behavioral probe — make the real
          unauthenticated call, read the real HTTP status — identically
          against every machine in scope, without relying on anyone
          remembering to look. On my most recent run, that exact class of
          gap showed up again on schedule (the gateway&apos;s
          authentication was found open), and was fixed and re-verified the
          same day. 8 of 10 flagged findings that run were fixed and
          verified live; 2 were correctly left for a human — full-disk
          encryption, because enabling it needs physical console access
          nothing the automation runs with can reach, and a home-router
          firewall rule, because it needs the router&apos;s own admin UI,
          not anything scriptable from either machine.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      heading: "Propose-and-approve is the design, not a gap I haven't closed",
      body: (
        <p>
          Neither router-watch nor security-watch has write access to the
          config it reports on. Every finding is a dated proposal a human
          reads and applies by hand, then the automation re-verifies. That
          durable record — a human decision attached to every change — is
          the actual product. An automation that silently applied its own
          fixes would still be making the same changes, but it would stop
          being evidence anyone could audit later.
