          says half of enterprise ERP vendors will launch autonomous governance modules — combining explainable AI,
          automated audit trails, and real-time compliance monitoring. It is a prediction, dated November 2025, not a
          description of what ships today, and it is worth planning around rather than arguing with. If your ERP vendor
          governs the agents that run inside its platform, use it.

        <>
          <p>
            A vendor module governs the agent activity it hosts, inside its own estate. That is real value, and no one
            else is better placed to do it. But its audit trail is produced by the same platform whose behavior it
            describes. For a control owner or an auditor, that is the platform&apos;s account of itself — useful, and
            one input rather than the whole record.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two further limits follow from where the boundary sits. A write that reaches the system through a path the
            vendor did not host — a third-party MCP server, an RPA script, a call from another vendor&apos;s platform —
            is outside the module&apos;s field of view. And a write that crosses systems has an approval trail that ends
            at the edge of whichever platform started it.

            (last updated June 8, 2026) says that the protocol specification is still maturing, with security,
            identity and governance requirements for enterprise deployments &ldquo;not yet fully addressed.&rdquo; SAP
            describes its own MCP Gateway as its answer for its own path. For customers and partners who build custom
            or third-party MCP servers, the same page assigns the controls to them — token exchange, input validation,
            rate limiting, circuit breakers, secrets management, and &ldquo;log every tool invocation including caller
            identity&rdquo; — and states that operational responsibility rests &ldquo;entirely with the customer or
            partner deploying it.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            That is a candid and reasonable statement of where a vendor&apos;s responsibility ends. It is also a
            description of the layer a buyer has to build or buy separately. On the Oracle side,{" "}

              Oracle&apos;s own E-Business Suite adapter documentation states that HTTP Basic authentication is the only

            , so on that path every agent write reaches EBS under one shared service account. The limit belongs to that
            adapter, not to EBS or to Oracle&apos;s roadmap, and it is a good example of a vendor&apos;s sanctioned path
            leaving the attribution question open.

            Use the vendor&apos;s module for what it governs. Keep whatever AI gateway or agent-security control plane you
            already run. Then close the part neither can vouch for on its own: that the write reached the system through
            its own application logic, that the system&apos;s native log attributes it, and that one record shows what was
            proposed, what policy ran, who approved, and what happened.
