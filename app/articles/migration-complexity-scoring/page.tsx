// Retired and retargeted 2026-09-10: this article originally described the
// scoring model behind the site's Oracle EBS -> S/4HANA migration-assessment
// demo, which was itself retired the same day (see next.config.js's
// redirect from /demos/migration-assessment). Keeping this piece describing
// a tool that no longer exists at that link would have been the site making
// a "here's evidence for my live demo" claim about a demo that's gone —
// retargeted to describe the real, current scoring model instead of leaving
// the URL up with a stale claim. The slug is left unchanged rather than
// adding a redirect nobody asked for; the content is what changed.

        <p>
          My live assessment tool scores readiness on a 1–10 scale (higher is
          more ready) from three concrete inputs: the target agent use case —
          AP invoice exceptions, procurement requisition triage, GL journal
          review, or expense auditing carry very different risk profiles —
          the current integration method (nothing yet, direct REST calls,
          Oracle Integration Cloud, or Oracle&apos;s own AI Agent Studio), and
          which governance controls are already in place: agent-scoped
          security roles, REST API scope discipline, an exported audit trail,
          and human-approval gates extended to agent-initiated actions. An
          AP-exceptions agent going through AI Agent Studio with all four
          controls in place and one with none of them are not the same risk,
          and shouldn&apos;t get the same readiness verdict from a template.
        </p>

      body: (
        <p>
          A readiness score with no explanation is a guess wearing a number.
          My tool requires the reasoning behind every score to reference the
          specific use case and controls that produced it — so whoever&apos;s
          reviewing the output can check whether the assessment actually
          engaged with their environment, rather than returning the same
          generic &ldquo;6 out of 10, proceed with caution&rdquo; regardless
          of input.

      ),

    {
      heading: "What this changes about scoping a real deployment",
      body: (
        <p>
          Treating a thin governance-control set as a structural blocker to
          autonomous agent action — not a stylistic nitpick to mention in
          passing — produces a recommended approach and a named-gaps list
          that&apos;s specific enough to argue with, which is the point. A
          readiness assessment that can&apos;t be disagreed with on specifics
          isn&apos;t doing its job.
