          <p>
            NIST AI RMF organizes controls under four functions — GOVERN, MAP,
            MEASURE, MANAGE. ISO 42001 and the EU AI Act use different labels
            for largely the same underlying obligations: documented authority
            and scope, risk identification, ongoing monitoring, and incident
            response. Teams that treat these as three separate audits end up
            building three separate evidence trails for the same operational
            fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            My own live demos tag every policy decision against the NIST
            function it maps to — GOVERN-1.5 for documented scope
            enforcement, MEASURE-2.7 for system behavior monitored against
            expectations, MANAGE-1.3 for risk escalation, MANAGE-4.1 for
            post-deployment monitoring. That tag is attached once, at the
            point the check runs — not retrofitted later by a compliance team
            trying to reconstruct what happened from application logs never
            designed to answer that question.

        <p>
          A control mapping built after the fact — a spreadsheet matching
          NIST subcategories to ISO clauses to EU AI Act articles — only
          proves the mapping exists on paper. It doesn&apos;t prove the
          control actually ran on a specific decision at a specific time. The
          difference matters the moment an auditor asks for evidence on one
          real transaction, not the policy document describing the intended
          process.

        <p>
          In my Governance Ledger demo, every model call my own routing
          infrastructure makes is logged automatically — not sampled, not
          added later — as a byproduct of how the router already works. That
          same principle extends to any agent action: the control tag is
          data on the decision record itself, which is what makes it possible
          to hand a reviewer one ledger and have it answer NIST, ISO, and EU
          AI Act questions without three different exports.
