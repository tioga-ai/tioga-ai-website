        <p>
          My own routing gateway has logged {TOTAL_CALLS} model calls in a
          two-day excerpt (Sep 8–9, 2026), an excerpt subtotal of ${TOTAL_SPEND.toFixed(6)}{" "}
          — not the 30-day window figure — against a $30-per-30-day cap: still a rounding error. The interesting number isn&apos;t the
          total, though; it&apos;s what happens to the free/paid split as
          real usage grows. {PAID_COUNT} of those {TOTAL_CALLS} calls
          resolved to a paid OpenRouter backend in this excerpt, versus{" "}
          {FREE_COUNT} that stayed on a local or Google free tier — a very
          different ratio from an earlier capture of this same ledger, when
          the free tier absorbed most of the volume. The routing policy
          hasn&apos;t changed: free and cheap backends are still tried
          first, by policy, not by luck. What changed is that real call
          volume has grown past what those backends alone can cover, so more
          calls now resolve to paid credit before the $30 cap is ever at
          risk. {FREE_ZERO_COST_COUNT} of {TOTAL_CALLS} calls in this excerpt settled at exactly $0 — even the one free-tier call carried ${FREE_POOL_SPEND.toFixed(6)} — worth naming
          honestly rather than only ever citing whichever window&apos;s
          numbers look best.

        <p>
          Cost governance tools that only measure spend after the fact tell
          you what happened. A router that decides, per call, whether a free
          local model, Google&apos;s free tier, or a paid OpenRouter backend
          actually serves the request changes what happens — the $30 monthly
          cap is a policy enforced before the call, with a per-request
          ceiling checked independently, not a number a dashboard reports
          after the bill arrives.

        <p>
          Every call records what model was requested versus what actually
          served it, tokens in and out, and cost — every call, not a
          statistical sample. That distinction matters for the same reason
          it matters in the governance frameworks this maps to (NIST AI RMF
          MANAGE-1.3, MAP, and MEASURE functions, see the framework mapping linked at the end): a sampled log can miss the one call that mattered. An
          unsampled one can&apos;t.
