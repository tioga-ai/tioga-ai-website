        <Section title="Agreement">
          <p>
            These terms govern your use of tioga.ai, including the live demos,
            chat assistant, and contact form (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), operated
            by Tiogasoft, L.L.C., a California limited liability company doing
            business as Tioga AI (&ldquo;Tioga AI,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;us&rdquo;). By using the Site, you agree to them. If you
            don&apos;t agree, don&apos;t use the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California,
            without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="What this page doesn't cover yet">
          <p>
            Stated plainly rather than left implicit: this page does not yet
            specify how a dispute would be resolved — venue, arbitration vs.
            court, class-action waivers, and similar mechanics. That&apos;s a
            real decision that belongs with an attorney, and we&apos;d rather
            say so directly than guess at an answer here that hasn&apos;t
            actually been reviewed. If that matters for how you&apos;re using
            this Site — for example, before referencing these Terms in a
            signed agreement — email{" "}
            <a href="mailto:hello@tioga.ai" className="underline hover:text-[var(--text)] transition-colors">
              hello@tioga.ai
            </a>{" "}
            first rather than assuming an answer.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="The demos are illustrative, not advice">
          <p>
            The invoice processing, email triage, document classification,
            and migration assessment demos exist to show how Tioga AI builds
            AI features against real systems. Their outputs are generated
            live by an AI model on the file or text you provide. The
            governance ledger demo instead shows a dated excerpt from Tioga
            AI&apos;s own operational history — it is not a live model call
            on your input. Both kinds are provided for evaluation purposes
            only — they are not financial, legal, tax, accounting, or
            compliance advice, and should not be relied on as such for any
            real business decision. Don&apos;t submit information you rely on
            being accurate without independent verification.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Acceptable use">
          <p>You agree not to use the Site to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
            <li>Submit unlawful, infringing, or malicious content, including attempts to extract, jailbreak, or abuse the underlying AI models.</li>
            <li>Submit another person&apos;s personal or confidential data without their consent.</li>
            <li>Probe, scan, overload, or otherwise attack the Site or its infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Misrepresent your identity when submitting the contact form.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We rate-limit demo and form endpoints and may block traffic that
            looks abusive.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="No warranty">
          <p>
            The Site and its demos are provided &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; without
            warranty of any kind. AI-generated output can be wrong. We don&apos;t
            guarantee the Site or demos will be uninterrupted, error-free, or
            fit for any particular purpose.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Limitation of liability">
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tioga AI is not liable for
            any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from
            your use of the Site or reliance on demo output. This Site does
            not create a client, consulting, or advisory relationship — that
            only happens under a separately signed engagement agreement or
            statement of work.

          <p>
            We may update these terms as the Site changes. Continued use after
            an update means you accept the revised terms. Material changes
